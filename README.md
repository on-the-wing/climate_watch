# Climate Watch
This is a space to collect all our scripts/tools for working with Audubon's Climate Watch data.

## myebird.py
1. Sign up for eBird API key
2. Put it in keys.txt file and change path to where yours lives. As it's written in the code, the keys.txt file is locally in one folder above the repo
3. There are examples at the top of the script commented out for various ways to read in a list of checklist ID's
